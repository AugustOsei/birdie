# Building Birdie: A Bird Identification Game from Concept to Production

## Introduction

I recently built and deployed [Birdie](https://birdie.augustwheel.com), a web-based bird identification game where players earn badges by correctly identifying birds. What started as a fun project idea turned into a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack development, containerization, and production deployment. Here's the story of how it came together.

## The Vision

Birdie is designed to make bird identification fun and engaging through:
- **Gamification**: Players identify birds from images with multiple choice options
- **Badge System**: Earn achievements for perfect scores and streaks
- **Educational Content**: Learn fun facts about each bird
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your improvement over time
- **No Daily Limits**: Practice as much as you want

The goal was to create something that felt like Duolingo but for bird watching enthusiasts.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**: Type-safe component development
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS3**: Custom animations and responsive design
- **Canvas Confetti**: Celebration effects for perfect scores

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**: RESTful API server
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for email subscriptions
- **Better-SQLite3**: Synchronous SQLite bindings for Node.js

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and orchestration
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **Let's Encrypt (Certbot)**: Free SSL/TLS certificates
- **AWS EC2**: Ubuntu 22.04 server hosting
- **GitHub**: Version control and CI/CD

### Security & Performance
- **Helmet**: Security headers
- **Express Rate Limiting**: API protection
- **Gzip Compression**: Optimized asset delivery
- **HTTPS Only**: Secure connections with automatic HTTP redirect

## Architecture

The application follows a containerized microservices architecture:

```
Internet (HTTPS)
    ‚Üì
Nginx Reverse Proxy (Port 443)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Container (React SPA)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Container (Express API)
         ‚Üì
    SQLite Database

Certbot Container (SSL Auto-renewal)
```

**Why This Architecture?**
1. **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add more services or scale horizontally
3. **Portability**: Runs anywhere Docker runs
4. **Security**: Nginx handles SSL termination and routing
5. **Maintainability**: Services can be updated independently

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Building the Game Mechanics

The first challenge was creating an engaging game loop:

```typescript
// Generate daily game with 9 birds in 3 sets
const generateDailyGame = (allBirds: Bird[]): GameSet[] => {
  const shuffled = [...allBirds].sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  const selectedBirds = shuffled.slice(0, 9);

  // Create 3 sets of 3 birds each
  return Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, setIndex) => ({
    birds: selectedBirds.slice(setIndex * 3, (setIndex + 1) * 3),
    revealed: false,
    userAnswers: new Map(),
  }));
};
```

Key features implemented:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Players answer birds in sets before seeing results
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå) after submission
- **Animated Fly-aways**: Correct birds fly off the screen
- **Score Calculation**: Track correct answers and streaks

### Phase 2: Badge System & Progress Tracking

I implemented a comprehensive achievement system:

```typescript
const AVAILABLE_BADGES = [
  {
    id: 'first-perfect',
    name: 'Perfect Start',
    icon: 'üåü',
    description: 'Score your first perfect game',
    requirement: '1 perfect score',
  },
  {
    id: 'certified-level-1',
    name: 'Certified Level 1 Birder',
    icon: 'üèÖ',
    description: 'Achieve 3 consecutive perfect scores',
    requirement: '3 perfect scores in a row',
  },
  // ... more badges
];
```

**Challenge**: How to track progress without user accounts?

**Solution**: Used browser `localStorage` to persist:
- Total games played
- Perfect score streaks
- Earned badges with timestamps
- Game history

This approach allows:
‚úÖ No login friction - play immediately
‚úÖ Privacy - data stays on user's device
‚úÖ Fast access - no database queries
‚ùå Limited to single device (addressed in roadmap)

### Phase 3: Email Subscriptions & Backend API

To collect feedback and notify users about updates, I built a simple API:

```javascript
// backend/src/server.js
app.post('/api/subscribe', subscribeLimit, async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;

  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      error: 'Valid email address required'
    });
  }

  const result = addSubscriber(email.toLowerCase().trim());

  if (result.success) {
    console.log(`‚úâÔ∏è  New subscriber: ${email}`);
    res.json({ success: true });
  } else {
    res.status(409).json({ success: false, error: result.error });
  }
});
```

**Why SQLite?**
- Perfect for low-to-medium traffic
- Single file, no separate database server
- Built-in with most Node.js deployments
- Easy to backup (just copy the file)

**Security Measures**:
- Rate limiting (5 requests per 15 minutes)
- Email validation and sanitization
- IP address logging (for spam prevention)
- HTTPS-only connections

### Phase 4: Docker Containerization

Creating a reproducible deployment was crucial:

```dockerfile
# Frontend Dockerfile - Multi-stage build
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent builds across environments
- Optimized image sizes (multi-stage builds)
- No "it works on my machine" issues
- Easy rollbacks via Docker tags

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: SSL Certificate Generation

**Problem**: Initial deployment script tried to start Nginx with SSL before certificates existed - chicken and egg problem!

```
nginx: [emerg] cannot load certificate
"/etc/letsencrypt/live/birdie.augustwheel.com/fullchain.pem":
No such file or directory
```

**Solution**: Two-phase deployment:
1. Start Nginx with HTTP-only config
2. Use Certbot to obtain certificate
3. Restart Nginx with SSL config

```bash
# Get certificate using standalone mode
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  certbot/certbot certonly --standalone \
  --email your-email@example.com \
  --agree-tos \
  -d birdie.augustwheel.com
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always handle the "first run" scenario differently from subsequent deployments.

### Challenge 2: TypeScript Strict Mode Errors

**Problem**: Build failing on unused variables:

```
error TS6133: 'newlyEarnedBadges' is declared but
its value is never read.
```

**Solution**: Prefix intentionally unused variables with underscore:

```typescript
// Before
const [newlyEarnedBadges, setNewlyEarnedBadges] = useState([]);

// After (TypeScript convention for unused variables)
const [_newlyEarnedBadges, setNewlyEarnedBadges] = useState([]);
```

**Lesson Learned**: TypeScript's strict mode catches issues early - embrace it!

### Challenge 3: Missing Build Dependencies

**Problem**: `npm ci` failing in Docker because `package-lock.json` was missing:

```
failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c npm ci --only=production"
did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

**Solution**: Generate and commit lock files:

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # Generates package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json"
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always commit lock files for reproducible builds!

### Challenge 4: .gitignore Accidentally Hiding Data

**Problem**: `birds.json` wasn't being committed to Git, causing build failures.

**Root Cause**: `.gitignore` had `data/` which caught both:
- `/data/` (database directory - should be ignored)
- `/birdie-app/public/data/` (bird data - needed!)

**Solution**: Make gitignore more specific:

```gitignore
# Before
data/

# After
/data/  # Only ignore root data directory
```

**Lesson Learned**: Be precise with `.gitignore` patterns - use `/` for root-only matching!

### Challenge 5: AWS Security Groups

**Problem**: Let's Encrypt couldn't reach the server to verify domain ownership.

**Root Cause**: EC2 security group wasn't allowing inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443.

**Solution**: Added inbound rules:
| Type | Protocol | Port | Source |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| HTTP | TCP | 80 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| HTTPS | TCP | 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 |

**Lesson Learned**: Check firewall rules BEFORE troubleshooting application issues!

## Deployment Process

The final deployment uses a single script (`deploy.sh`) that:

1. ‚úÖ Checks for Docker and Docker Compose
2. ‚úÖ Installs them if missing
3. ‚úÖ Creates necessary directories
4. ‚úÖ Obtains SSL certificates
5. ‚úÖ Builds Docker images
6. ‚úÖ Starts all services
7. ‚úÖ Runs health checks

**One-command deployment**:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
